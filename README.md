## Hi there 👋
 
Hello, my name is Caleb and I am a Cybersecurity Major at Grand Valley State University and I have a deep passion for Programming and leadership as well. 

I am currently an Intern at American Seating company, it being a small IT team means that I have to do alot more than help desk, I have learned alot about networking and server management as well.

I am also the President of the Hackers Analyzing Threats club(H.A.T.) at GVSU and serve as the Chair for the Dean Student Advisory Council for the College of Computing.

My hobbies currently are working out and video games.

My top 3 favorite programming languages are: C, C++, Python.

My current career goals are to become a cybersecurity engineer, one day entering leadership positions.
